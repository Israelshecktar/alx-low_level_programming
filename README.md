# 💻 Project Title: ALX Low Level Programming 💻

# 📋Description:

This repository contains projects for ALX School's SE programme and foasters my journey into becoming a software engineer, primarily focusing on low-level languages, particularly C programming language. The projects entails concepts from simple concepts such as data types and loops to more advanced topics like dynamic and static libraries, binary trees, and multi-threading.

# 📦 Installation:

To run these projects, you need to install `GCC` and `make`. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Israelshecktar/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

# 🔧 Usage:

Navigate to each project directory, compile C files using GCC, and then run the resulting binary.

For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o output
./output
```

# 🎯 Concepts Covered:
This project extensively covers:

**C basics**: Data types, operators, functions, loops, conditional statements, etc.
Pointers, arrays, and strings: Understanding and manipulating pointers, multi-dimensional arrays,, and different types of strings
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Implementation of Malloc and Free
**Static and Dynamic libraries**: Creating and using libraries in C
File Descriptors: Handling and manipulation of file descriptors
